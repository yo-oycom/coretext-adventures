You awaken at a crossroads, the morning mist swirling around your feet like ethereal tendrils. The air is thick with possibility, and you can feel the weight of choice pressing down upon you.



To your left, ancient stone ruins rise from the earth like broken teeth, their weathered surfaces whispering secrets of civilizations long forgotten. To your right, a dense forest stretches into the horizon, its emerald canopy swaying gently in the breeze, promising both wonder and danger.

The path you choose now will shape not just your journey, but the very essence of who you become. The ruins call to the explorer within, promising treasure and knowledge hidden in their depths, while the forest beckons to something more primal, more connected to the natural world.

Which path calls to your soul?
