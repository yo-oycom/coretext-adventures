You have chosen to return to the outside world, and as you make this decision, you feel a mixture of sadness and determination. The High Lama nods understandingly, and you can see the wisdom in his ancient eyes.

"The outside world needs people like you," he says. "People who have seen what is possible, who carry the light of Shangri-La within them. Your journey here has changed you, and you will carry these lessons with you always."

{{#if (score "knowledge" ">=" 5)}}
Your time in the library and your understanding of Shangri-La's true purpose will serve you well in the outside world. You carry not just memories, but wisdom that could help humanity find a better path.

As you prepare to leave, Chang gives you a small, beautifully crafted book. "This contains some of the most important lessons from our library," he explains. "Use it wisely, and perhaps one day you will find your way back to us."

The journey back through the mountain passes is bittersweet. Every step takes you further from the paradise you've discovered, but also closer to the world that needs the wisdom you've gained. The path seems to guide you effortlessly, as if the mountains themselves are helping you on your way.

When you finally emerge from the mountains, you find yourself in a world that seems both familiar and strange. The chaos and conflict of human civilization are still there, but now you see them with new eyes. You understand that change is possible, that wisdom and peace are not just dreams but achievable goals.

Your experiences in Shangri-La have changed you forever. You carry the valley's lessons in your heart, and though you may never find your way back to that hidden paradise, its influence will guide you for the rest of your life.

You have chosen to be a bridge between two worldsâ€”the timeless wisdom of Shangri-La and the ever-changing reality of human civilization. Your story will inspire others to seek their own paths to wisdom and understanding.

**The End**
